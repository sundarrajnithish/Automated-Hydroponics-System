# Automated-Hydroponics-System
We made a system that sets ideal conditions for a plant to grow without the presence of the soil.

The system was programmed using Arduino IDE.
An Arduino MEGA 2560, 4x4 Keypad, 16x2 LCD Display, DHT11 Sensor, pH Level Senor, Water Level Sensor, An All Spectrum Grow Light, Fluorescent Lights, 40W Submersible Water Pump and Mini Sump Motors, Large Water Reservoir, Mineral Reservoirs and a Custom made Humidifier were used. A custom made powder coated aluminium frame was designed for this purpose and a custom fitted PVC pipe was placed in an angle on this frame such that the water gradually flows down the reservoir.

This system maintains the ideal conditions of a plant through balancing the water pH by adding minerals from the mineral reservoirs above. The Lighting setup provides the plants essential lighting conditions to grow. To maintain a specific humidity level a humifier is used.

This system can either be automated or controlled manually through a Keypad provided on the frame which is used to operate the whole system in different modes namely Automatic, Manual & Economy Mode.

This system due to it's small form factor will occupy only a small area indoor. Hydrophonics compatible plants can be cultivated on this system provided the necessary supplements are introduced.
